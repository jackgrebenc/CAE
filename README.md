# CAE Model
Applying a Compressive Autoencoder (CAE) to image data from The USC-SIPI Image Database. Applying a Compressive Autoencoder (CAE) to image data from The USC-SIPI Image Database. The CAE model is from https://github.com/alexandru-dinu/cae as is based on [1]. This is a work in progress and the training of the model and the model itself are a work in progress
